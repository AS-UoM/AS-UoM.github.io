											<h3>Simulated Differential Drive Robot Using ROS2</h3>
											<p>One of the courseworks for the Software for Robotics module I completed during the first semester of my MSc consisted of the creation of a simulated differential drive robot
											using the framework of ROS2 with the command terminal to output data. This required the use of specific interfaces which I had to develop, using both ROS2
											services and messages. I created multiple functions that would allow the user to turn on the robot, returning a success message if the robot was not already on, and ignores the message otherwise,
											with similar interactions for the off control. Functions that facilitated message or service publishing at a required frequency was also implemented, with a difference between input data collection
											and publish rate being accounted for in the code. I also had to implement differential drive kinematics in order to move the simulated robot to a required position.
											</p>
											<h4>Goals:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Create a simulated robot that can travel to a specific location.</li>
												<li>Ensure the robot turns on and off using ROS2 nodes.</li>
												<li>Provide a sensor which outputs data at a specified time interval.</li>
											</ul>
											<h4>My Contributions:</h4>
											<p>I created all required packages and nodes for the simulated robot. I also created the publishers, subscribers, servers and clients which were used by the nodes. The rest of the requirements such
											as wheel velocity and position control were developed by me as it was an individual coursework.

											<h3>Gazebo Simulation of Differential Drive Robot</h3>
											<p>The second coursework in my Software for Robotics module involved the creation of a URDF model of an autonomous differential drive vehicles with specific specifications,
											which would be able to map out the surrounding environment using simulated sensors such as a LiDAR. This included the use of xacro to be able to store variables and reuse them when needed
											instead of repeating each one as in URDF. The simulation used Gazebo and RViz with a given simulated map which then had to be seen by the LiDAR and camera system.
											</p>
											<h4>Goals:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Create a 3D URDF file model of a robot tto required specifications.</li>
												<li>Ensure the SLAM toolbox correctly functions with the simulated robot in Gazebo.</li>
												<li>Create an accurate RQT graph for the robot system.</li>
											</ul>
											<h4>My Contributions:</h4>
											<p>Most requirements for the coursework were completed, with the main missing components being the twist function node and slight errors in the URDF model. Every other aspect of the
											coursework was completted by me in Python.

											<h3>Neural Networks using PyTorch and Machine Learning using Numpy and Pandas</h3>
											<p>In this university project there were two main tasks involving the use of Numpy and Pandas to do data splitting, imputation, model training and evaluation, but also another task
											which three different optimisers were created using PyTorch to be used in the training of a neural network on the MNIST classification dataset. The optimisers created were a Stochastic
											Gradient Descent (SGD), Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum and AdaGrad optimiser. Additionally, code to train the datasets was developed and run, with the results shown in the
											github repository shown with 'More Information'.
											</p>
											<h4>Goals:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Develop SGD, SGD with momentum and AdaGrad machine learning optimisers.</li>
												<li>Find the optimal w value with SGD.</li>
												<li>Train and output results for trained machine learning models.</li>
											</ul>
											<h4>My Contributions:</h4>
											<p>I developed three optimiser code snippets using PyTorch and accompanying training and validatioon code. This meant I could train the machine learning model and output the data into a text document.
											I also created an SGD optimiser without PyTorch and trained it, to allow it to output its error after testing. This was done within two Jupyter notebooks
											provided as part of the coursework.

											<h3>A* Obstacle Avoidance and Navigation Algorithm</h3>
											<p>One of the tasks completed during my MSc Robotics course is the creation of an A-Star algorithm using only Python for the main program and pyQT5 to provide an interactable
											GUI. It consisted of the research of the A* algorithm from previous literature and online resources, with the implementation of the algorithm in a separate
											C++ file which would be loaded when running the simulation.
											</p>
											<h4>Goals:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Develop A* algorithm that successfully avoids obstacles.</li>
												<li>Develop A* algorithm that finds the optimal path with the given heuristics.</li>
												<li>Ensure that the A* algorithm is optimised to execute quickly.</li>
											</ul>
											<h4>My Contributions:</h4>
											<p>Without the use of libraries, I created the code which ran inside the function called by the GUI to perform the A* algorithm. Each subfunction was developed to perform all the checks and comparisons
											required for the A* algorithm to operate, such as checking that the next node is not part of a 'closed set' or that a node in the gridspace was not classed as an obstacle
											and therefore blocking the path.

											<h3>Serial Decoder Program</h3>
											<p>Another completed project is the development of a serial decoder which would take a binary file as input, decode it and convert it into a CSV file containing
											its data. This was developed in Python and can parse individual complete dataframes, discarding invalid size frames and storing valid frames in a list which is then transferred to
											a CSV file to make it human readable and as required by the project.

											<h3>LiDAR Testing and Characterisation</h3>
											<p>In this research project, an RPLiDAR A2M12 was tested to measure multiple characteristics such as maximum and minimum range, error over distance, error between material colour
											and the angle resolution. A variety of experiments were taken as explained in the above video. The experiments were created and undertaken in a team of 3 but the video was created individually and shows
											the experimental results.

											<h3>BEng Mechatronics PCB Project</h3>
											<p>My BEng third year project focused on the development of a bespoke printed circuit board designed to
											provide a platform to compare mixed signal crosstalk performance between multiple different ground plane layer designs.
											It included the creation of a suitable circuit diagram and schematic, implementing digital, analogue and mixed signal
											electrical components in a PCB layout, enhancing electrical tesing skills. This project was designed to provide quantitative evidence on an area of study
											with less published work to be able to contribute to the qualitative evidence already available.

											<h3>Research on Robotics Systems for Sustainable Development</h3>
											<p>As part of my MSc course, I created a video exploring the use of robotic systems with regards to sustainability, the United Nations'
											Sustainable Development Goals and ethical use. It focused on the classification of robots as according to the International Federation of 
											Robotics, explaining the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and how robots are used across them, finishing with a study on a 
											specific use-case of robotics in terms of a specific sustainable development goal (SDG 2).

											<h3>BEng Group Project - Line-following Semi-autonomous Robot</h3>
											<p>As part of the second year of my BEng Mechatronics course, me and and my second year group members created and programmed a semi-autonomous mobile robot
											designed to follow a series of straight and curved lines using optical sensors. This robot was tasked with the ability to follow a white line on a black track with any unseen
											track shape, completing multiple demonstrations over the project's lifespan, ending with a final demonstration. Alongside the robot, sensor and motor characterisation
											research was taken, with multiple reports being created based on the robot.

											<h3>Research and Experiments on Control of Wheeled Robots using MATLAB and Simulink</h3>
											<p>During this research, open-loop and closed-loop control methods were implemented in a simulation of a differential drive robot represented
											in 2D space. This research recorded the position and trajectory of the simulated robot over a period of time, allowing for comparisons between results
											and the explanation of the benefits of closed-loop control in a robotic system.

									<div class="features">
										<article>
										<ul>
											<li>Fusion 360 Design Software - Solid and Form Modelling:</li>
											<p>I have designed and 3D modelled multiple mechanical parts such as custom servo motor holders, robotic head movement
											system and other robotic chassis parts. I have also modelled non-geometric components such as the outer shell for my
											robot project's outer shell which takes a humanoid shape and therefore had to bre created using Fusion 360's forms function
											from primitive shapes to more advanced shapes. During the LEO rover project I modelled the payload sled which was refined and improved
											in an iterative process to improve its compaibility and versatility with the rover.
											</p>
											<li>Altium Designer - Schematic and PCB Layout Development:</li>
											<p>My two PCB project designs are the main source of skill development in Altium PCB Designer, however I am also currently designing the PCB for my
											handheld console project which will incorporate the power management, bare-metal microcontroller design implementation and programming skills developed in my
											3rd year project. I am currently learning how to integrate external flash storage into my circuit designs and integrate a RealSense F450 into a facial recognition
											system with a custom PCB to allow connectivity between it and a PC or microcontroller. 
											</p>
											<li>STM32 Microcontroller Programming:</li>
											<p>I have developed my knowledge in programming STM32 family microcontrollers during my 3rd year individual project through using the STM32CubeIDE,
											getting experience in using the GPIO pin configuration features that IDE provides. It also involved using the Low Level STM32 library to directly toggle and interact with
											specific GPIO pins. As most commercial accessory modules such as speech synthesiser boards or LCD screens are designed to work with Arduino microcontrollers, I also worked
											with the STM32 family in the Arduino IDE in order to use a speech synthesis board not tested with the STM32.	
											</p>
											<li>C++ Programming:</li>
											<p>My C++ programming skills were mainly developed during my undergraduate degree through the programming platforms of MBed, Keil Studio and STM32CubeIDE. 
											MBed was used in conjunction with an STM32F401RE Nucleo board to control peripheral devices attached through an accessory hat in order to complete different tasks such as a timer
											with customisable duration and interfacing with an LCD screen. This high-level control was improved later on by using C++ with the microcontroller and an EEPROM in order to
											demonstrate data networking between a microcontroller and EEPROM, using the Keil Studio programming platform. During my concurrent systems module I completed a coursework in which
											a relay race was simulated in C++ using threads, semaphores and other programming constructs needed to achieve race conditions, which provided me with programming experience in a PC application
											rather than a microcontroller application, which had been the main focus during my undergraduate degree.												
											</p>
											<li>Python Programming:</li>
											<p>The MSc degree has improved my Python programming skills, going from previously never writing a Python application to creating a binary file decoder and A-Star path finding algorithm. This is related to
											the ROS2 skills I have also developed as I transferred my C++ programming skills over to Python when writing ROS2 packages which were taught in Python rather than C++. In addition to this, programming constructs such as
											classes, sets and lists were implemented into my A-Star program, deepening my understanding of those programming concepts.
											</p>
											<li>Electrical Circuit Testing:</li>
											<p>I have gained experience in electrical fault finding and oscilloscope testing throughout hte duration of my undergraduate degree, particularly in my 3rd year project
											where I had to make adjustments to my PCB after finding unexpected signals using a benchtop oscilloscope. This experience then allowed me to adjust parts of my PCB project
											design to allow more accurate and effective measurements. I also frequently tested rise time and other electrical characteristics such as the pulse width of my SPI signals
											in order to match the electrical signals I generated with a microcontroller with the required signal patterns needed for the operation of my PCB. This provided critical experience in
											identifying and linking electrical problems in my circuit to observed behaviours in different parts of the board so in future PCB designs I can avoid making those mistakes or remedy
											similar problems in the future.									
											</p>
											<li>ROS2:</li>
											<p>During the MSc degree ROS2 was and is a critical component of my rover project. It provides a framework for multiple programs to run concurrently and interact with each other
											and was used to create the operating algorithms in my rover project. My understanding of the ROS2 framework was developed in the first semester of my MSc degree through weekly assessments
											covering key aspects of ROS2 from basic package and node creation to the use of messages, services and launch files, with another focus on robot simulation through the use of RViz and Gazebo.
											This was implemented in the rover through incorporating normal python programs for manipulator arm control, depth camera and navigation into separate ROS2 nodes and connecting them together through
											ROS2 messages, allowing programs developed by me and my team members to transmit data between each other. The coursework for differential drive robot simulation in ROS2 also improved my ROS2 programming skills
											by focusing on node control through publishers and subscribers, increasing my understanding of cross-node connection within a ROS2 system and managing the system's behaviour.
											</p>
											<li>Robotic Systems Development:</li>
											<p>Through the projects undertaken and modules learnt during my undergaduate and postgraduate degrees, I have an understanding of a range of aspects of a robotic system as demonstrated in the group rover project.
											I have progressed from single programs on microcontrollers to integrating multiple parts of a multi-functional robotic system, with iterative design improvements in physical and programming
											aspects. As shown in my other skills, I can plan and develop a robotic system that incorporates multiple engineering principles.
											</p>
											<li>Robotic Manipulator Development:</li>
											<p>My main contribution to the group rover project was the precise control of a robotic manipulator. I used a robotic manipulator in conjunction with a depth camera in order to identify and manipulate targeted objects. This
											was supplemented with knowledge gained on forward and inverse kinematics learnt during my MSc degree.
