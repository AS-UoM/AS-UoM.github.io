											<h3>Mobile Humanoid Robot</h3>
											<p>My main personal project, this project is the creation and development of a mobile humanoid robot
											capable of movement, speech recognition and synthesis, machine vision and facial recognition. This 
											project involves a wide range of engieering principles, including 3D modelling and printing, custom PCB design,
											control system programming and machine learning.</p>

											<h3>STM32-based Handheld Console</h3>
											<p>My secondary personal project is a handheld console designed to develop my microcontroller
											firmware programming skills and increase my experience with microcontroller peripheral components and communication protocols. 
											The skills gained from this project are then to be implemented in my robotics projects.

											<h3>BEng Mechatronics PCB Project</h3>
											<p>My BEng third year project focused on the development of a bespoke printed circuit board designed to
											provide a platform to compare mixed signal crosstalk performance between multiple different ground plane layer designs.
											It included the creation of a suitable circuit diagram and schematic, implementing digital, analogue and mixed signal
											electrical components in a PCB layout. The project also developed electrical testing skills and provided experience
											developing a PCB design through an iterative approach. This project was designed to provide quantitative evidence on an area of study
											with less published work to be able to contribute to the qualitative evidence already available.

											<h3>Research on Robotics Systems for Sustainable Development</h3>
											<p>As part of my MSc course, I created a video exploring the use of robotic systems with regards to sustainability, the United Nations'
											Sustainable Development Goals and ethical use. It focused on the classification of robots as according to the International Federation of 
											Robotics, explaining the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and how robots are used across them, finishing with a study on a 
											specific use-case of robotics in terms of a specific sustainable development goal (SDG 2).

											<h3>Leo Rover MSc Group Project</h3>
											<p>This project is a group-based MSc project involving the assembly and programming of a fully autonomous mobile robot designed
											to identify and manipulate specified objects. My role in the group is the team leader and finisher. At the current stage, the base robot is assembled and the group is in the process of
											testing the wheel and camera functions.

											<h3>Research on Robots in Ethically Aligned Design (EAD)</h3>
											<p>This research explored the ethical use and impact of autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS), researching Ethically Aligned Design as a concept
											and its importance. It further analyses ethical design through research on diverse ethical practices and how those values could be embedded into autonomous
											and intelligent systems to improve the ethical impaxt of autonomous systems.

											<h3>BEng Group Project - Line-following Semi-autonomous Robot</h3>
											<p>As part of the second year of my BEng Mechatronics course, me and and my second year group members created and programmed a semi-autonomous mobile robot
											designed to follow a series of straight and curved lines using optical sensors. This robot was tasked with the ability to follow a white line on a black track with any unseen
											track shape, completing multiple demonstrations over the project's lifespan, ending with a final demonstration. Alongside the robot, sensor and motor characterisation
											research was taken, with multiple report being created based on the robot.

											<h3>Research and Experiments on Control of Wheeled Robots using MATLAB and Simulink</h3>
											<p>During this research, open-loop and closed-loop control methods were implemented in a simulation of a differential drive robot represented
											in 2D space. This research recorded the position and trajectory of the simulated robot over a period of time, allowing for comparisons between results
											and the explanation of the benefits of closed-loop control in a robotic system.
