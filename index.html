											<h3>BEng Mechatronics PCB Project</h3>
											<p>My BEng third year project focused on the development of a bespoke printed circuit board designed to
											provide a platform to compare mixed signal crosstalk performance between multiple different ground plane layer designs.
											It included the creation of a suitable circuit diagram and schematic, implementing digital, analogue and mixed signal
											electrical components in a PCB layout, enhancing electrical tesing skills. This project was designed to provide quantitative evidence on an area of study
											with less published work to be able to contribute to the qualitative evidence already available.

											<h3>BEng Group Project - Line-following Semi-autonomous Robot</h3>
											<p>As part of the second year of my BEng Mechatronics course, me and and my second year group members created and programmed a semi-autonomous mobile robot
											designed to follow a series of straight and curved lines using optical sensors. This robot was tasked with the ability to follow a white line on a black track with any unseen
											track shape, completing multiple demonstrations over the project's lifespan, ending with a final demonstration. Alongside the robot, sensor and motor characterisation
											research was taken, with multiple reports being created based on the robot.

											<h3>A* Obstacle Avoidance and Navigation Algorithm</h3>
											<p>One of the tasks completed during my MSc Robotics course is the creation of an A-Star algorithm using only Python for the main program and pyQT5 to provide an interactable
											GUI. It consisted of the resaearch of the A* algorithm from previous literature and online resources, with the implementation of the algorithm in a separate
											C++ file which would be loaded when running the simulation.

											<h3>LiDAR Testing and Characterisation</h3>
											<p>In this research project, an RPLiDAR A2M12 was tested to measure multiple characteristics such as maximum and minimum range, error over distance, error between material colour
											and the angle resolution. A variety of experiments were taken as explained in the above video. The experiments were created and undertaken in a team of 3 but the video was created individually and shows
											the experimental results.

										<article>
										<ul>
											<li>Fusion 360 Design Software - Solid and Form Modelling:</li>
											<p>I have designed and 3D modelled multiple mechanical parts such as custom servo motor holders, robotic head movement
											system and other robotic chassis parts. I have also modelled non-geometric components such as the outer shell for my
											robot project's outer shell which takes a humanoid shape and therefore had to bre created using Fusion 360's forms function
											from primitive shapes to more advanced shapes. During the LEO rover project I modelled the payload sled which was refined and improved
											in an iterative process to improve its compaibility and versatility with the rover.
											</p>
											<li>Altium Designer - Schematic and PCB Layout Development:</li>
											<p>My two PCB project designs are the main source of skill development in Altium PCB Designer, however I am also currently designing the PCB for my
											handheld console project which will incorporate the power management, bare-metal microcontroller design implementation and programming skills developed in my
											3rd year project. I am currently learning how to integrate external flash storage into my circuit designs and integrate a RealSense F450 into a facial recognition
											system with a custom PCB to allow connectivity between it and a PC or microcontroller. 
											</p>
											<li>STM32 Microcontroller Programming:</li>
											<p>I have developed my knowledge in programming STM32 family microcontrollers during my 3rd year individual project through using the STM32CubeIDE,
											getting experience in using the GPIO pin configuration features that IDE provides. It also involved using the Low Level STM32 library to directly toggle and interact with
											specific GPIO pins. As most commercial accessory modules such as speech synthesiser boards or LCD screens are designed to work with Arduino microcontrollers, I also worked
											with the STM32 family in the Arduino IDE in order to use a speech synthesis board not tested with the STM32.	
											</p>
											<li>C++ Programming:</li>
											<p>My C++ programming skills were mainly developed during my undergraduate degree through the programming platforms of MBed, Keil Studio and STM32CubeIDE. 
											MBed was used in conjunction with an STM32F401RE Nucleo board to control peripheral devices attached through an accessory hat in order to complete different tasks such as a timer
											with customisable duration and interfacing with an LCD screen. This high-level control was improved later on by using C++ with the microcontroller and an EEPROM in order to
											demonstrate data networking between a microcontroller and EEPROM, using the Keil Studio programming platform. During my concurrent systems module I completed a coursework in which
											a relay race was simulated in C++ using threads, semaphores and other programming constructs needed to achieve race conditions, which provided me with programming experience in a PC application
											rather than a microcontroller application, which had been the main focus during my undergraduate degree.												
											</p>
											<li>Python Programming:</li>
											<p>The MSc degree has improved my Python programming skills, going from previously never writing a Python application to creating a binary file decoder and A-Star path finding algorithm. This is related to
											the ROS2 skills I have also developed as I transferred my C++ programming skills over to Python when writing ROS2 packages which were taught in Python rather than C++. In addition to this, programming constructs such as
											classes, sets and lists were implemented into my A-Star program, deepening my understanding of those programming concepts.
											</p>
											<li>Electrical Circuit Testing:</li>
											<p>I have gained experience in electrical fault finding and oscilloscope testing throughout hte duration of my undergraduate degree, particularly in my 3rd year project
											where I had to make adjustments to my PCB after finding unexpected signals using a benchtop oscilloscope. This experience then allowed me to adjust parts of my PCB project
											design to allow more accurate and effective measurements. I also frequently tested rise time and other electrical characteristics such as the pulse width of my SPI signals
											in order to match the electrical signals I generated with a microcontroller with the required signal patterns needed for the operation of my PCB. This provided critical experience in
											identifying and linking electrical problems in my circuit to observed behaviours in different parts of the board so in future PCB designs I can avoid making those mistakes or remedy
											similar problems in the future.
